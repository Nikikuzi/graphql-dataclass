py-graphql-mapper Release Update

Release notes version: 1.1.1

Release date: Jul. 2, 2023

Changes

* Query types not recognized anymore following the conventional "Query" definition but checking *__schema -> QueryType -> name* definition

Bug fixes

* Queries having payload as list return only 1 element of the list: the issue has been solved, also the list type will not show anymore the element type fields in the result

Release notes version: 1.1.0

Release date: Feb. 10, 2023

Features

* Assignment of arguments through parameters: other than using _arg object to set the arguments, now it is possible to assign arguments also using kwargs during construction of the parent object.

Bug fixes

* Check for NonNullability types: nonnull types will be recognized when using arguments and variables (setting ! in GraphQL syntax).
